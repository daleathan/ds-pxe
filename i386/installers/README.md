# Packages to install

Packages here go into the `custom` directory on the installation media, and thence to the `.installers` directory in the users home directory.

You'll probably want RStudio here, at least.

```
curl -LO http://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-1.1.463-i386.deb
```

See the `Makefile` in this directory.
